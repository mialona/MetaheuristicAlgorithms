# Development of (meta)heuristic algorithms for the optimization of a double head machine
 Final master's project in which the development (meta)heuristic algorithms has been applied, specifically for the optimization of the problem of a double head machine.
 In this repository you can find the implementation of the three algorithms discussed in that work:
- **Local Search algorithm**: Solution search algorithm that uses local search to move through the solution space. Based on VNS-type algorithms.
- **Genetic algorithm**: Evolutionary solution search algorithm based on the Abstract Genetic Algorithm scheme. Uses crossover and mutation operations focused on the order of operations.
- **GM-EDA**: Evolutionary solution search algorithm based on estimating distributions using the Distance-Based Ranking Model.
