    The 'exchanges_between_heads' function exchanges operations randomly between
    head A and B depending on the sum of times of each head.

        data: List with the values of the operations.
        ops_a: List with the id of operations in head A.
        ops_b: List with the id of operations in head B.
        percent: Solution efficiency percentage.
        sum_head_a: Sum of the times of the head A.
        sum_head_b: Sum of the times of the head B.
        M1_head_A: Maximum coordinate of head A.
        M2_head_B: Minimum coordinate of head A.
        M3_collision: Minimum distance between heads.

        ops_a: List with the id of new operations in head A.
